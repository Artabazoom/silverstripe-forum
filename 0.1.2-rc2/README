This is v0.1 of Forum module to help developers learn about how to create a SilverStripe module,
and to allow adventureous hackers to try out and improve the forum. More documentation will follow shortly.

This release should be considered beta-quality.

To install:

1. Place this directory in the root of your SilverStripe installation
I.e. you will now have the following root folders

assets
mysite
cms
jsparty
forum

2. Run /db/build/

3. The CMS should now have "Forum Holder" and "Forum" page types.
Add these and visit them on the public site.

Please raise issues, bugs, contributions in the silverstripe.com forum...
